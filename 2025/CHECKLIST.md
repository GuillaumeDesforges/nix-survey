        - [ ] (check for new teams)
    - limited count (e.g. max 4)
    - only yes/no, categorical or multiple choice
        - use ranking questions sparingly, too many options are confusing
        - limit to one open-ended question, they are costly to analyze (ask @fricklerhandwerk)
        - always add "other" field to selections
    - no conditionality/branching
