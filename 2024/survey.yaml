title: Nix Community Survey 2024
intro: >
  Welcome to this year's Nix Community Survey!
  Please take 5-10 minutes to fill out this survey with info about yourself and how you use projects in the Nix ecosystem.
  We hope to use your responses to develop Nix, Nixpkgs, and NixOS to better match your needs and come up with new ideas for serving and growing the community.
  Please note that when we only say "Nix" in a question, we refer to the Nix tool and/or language.
  When we want to refer to Nixpkgs, NixOS, or the Nix ecosystem as a whole, we'll be clear with the terms.
