## Discourse announcement

Dear Nix Community,

It is with excitement that we launch 2024's Nix Survey!

https://survey.nixos.org/2024

We are conducting this survey to improve our understanding of the community and what everyone cares about.
We plan to use your responses to support Nix Teams to better serve the community.

As always, the survey is **anonymous**
Aggregated statistics and major findings will be published on Discourse.

Check out the announcements and results from past years:
- [Nix Community Survey 2023](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-community-survey-2023/28988/1)
- [NixOS Community Survey 2022](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-community-survey-2022/17952)

We used last year's feedback to improve yet again.
- The survey is lighter to complete.
- Question prompts are more inclusive.

Feedback is very welcome!

Many thanks to @ronef @Th√©ophane @danielsidhion @tomberek @fricklerhandwerk @hexa @Julien for the great help.
